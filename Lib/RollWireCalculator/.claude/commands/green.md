description: Write minimum code to pass the test (GREEN phase of TDD cycle)
---

You are in the GREEN phase of the TDD cycle.

Your task:
1. Implement ONLY the minimum code needed to make the failing test pass
2. Do NOT add extra features or "nice to have" functionality
3. Do NOT refactor or improve structure yet
4. Use the simplest solution that could possibly work
5. Run all tests (except long-running tests) to verify they pass

Remember:
- This is the second step of Red → Green → Refactor
- Focus on making it work, not making it perfect
- Duplication and ugly code are acceptable at this stage
- Once tests pass, you can move to /refactor phase
- Only write enough code to turn the red test green
