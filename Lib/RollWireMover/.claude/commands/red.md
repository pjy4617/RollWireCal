description: Write a failing test (RED phase of TDD cycle)
---

You are in the RED phase of the TDD cycle.

Your task:
1. Write a failing test that defines a small increment of functionality
2. The test should:
   - Have a meaningful name that describes the expected behavior
   - Test only ONE thing
   - Make test failures clear and informative
   - Be as simple as possible
3. Run the test to confirm it fails for the right reason
4. Do NOT implement any production code yet

Remember:
- This is the first step of Red → Green → Refactor
- The test should fail because the functionality doesn't exist yet
- Write just enough test code to specify the next small behavior
- Next step will be /green to make this test pass
